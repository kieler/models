# KIELER Models Repository (Public)

This repository holds test models for the [KIELER](http://www.rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/en/research/kieler) project.
These test files are used while developing our layout algorithms, to reproduce and fix bugs, and to run automated tests to ensure the bugs remain fixed.


## Repository Layout

On the top level, the repository contains the following folders:

Folder        |  Description
--------------|-------------
`tests`       | Test graphs written or generated by us or others.
`realworld`   | Models obtained by converting examples from the real world into formats we can use.
`tickets`     | Models that reproduce problems described in tickets.
`collections` | Somewhere in-between `tests` and `realworld`: Larger collections of models that are usually derived from real world models and may serve as a basis for evaluations.  

Both `tests` and `tickets` are further subdivided
into folders specific to the models' context (e.g. 'ptolemy', 'sccharts').
In the `test` tree,
these folders may contain further folders specific to the respective tickets
if more than one file is produced for a given ticket.


## File Types

The file types we use are the following:

Type      | Description
----------|--------------------
`.elkt`   | Textual ELK graph language. See [the specification](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/documentation/tooldevelopers/graphdatastructure/elktextformat.html).
`.elkg`   | EMF's XMI-based representation of ELK graphs.
`.json`   |Â JSON files. See [the specification](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/documentation/tooldevelopers/graphdatastructure/jsonformat.html).
`.md`     | Readme files can be placed in folders to describe their purpose.
